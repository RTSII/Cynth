# CynthAI Content Creation Guidelines

This document outlines the standards, best practices, and requirements for creating exercise content for the CynthAI platform, ensuring consistency, quality, and safety for our senior users.

## Core Content Principles

All CynthAI content adheres to five core principles:

1. **Safety First**: All exercises prioritize user safety with proper form, appropriate modifications, and clear precautions.

2. **Evidence-Based**: Content is grounded in established research on exercise physiology, yoga, tai chi, and senior fitness.

3. **Inclusive and Accessible**: All content accommodates various ability levels and offers modifications for different needs.

4. **Clear and Comprehensible**: Instructions use simple language and visual demonstrations that are easy to follow.

5. **Progressive and Empowering**: Content builds skills systematically and emphasizes positive reinforcement.

## Audio Requirements

## Instructional Language Guidelines

### Vocabulary Standards

#### Technical Terminology Usage

NOTE: Cynthia (User) is a retired medical professional with extensive knowledge of anatomy and medical terminology. Use proper technical terms to engage users' cognitive abilities. This approach supports the future CynthAI Brain Activity feature that will incorporate mini quiz games/puzzles focused on Science/Medicine subjects.

#### Approved Terminology Examples

| Technical Term | Description for Context |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| External rotation | Movement of a limb around its long axis away from the midline |
| Anterior tilt | Forward tipping movement of the pelvis |
| Scapular retraction | Drawing shoulder blades together toward spine |
| Pronate | Rotation of forearm that turns palm downward |
| Dorsiflexion | Movement that brings top of foot closer to shin |

### Instruction Phrasing

#### Effective Instruction Patterns

- **Action + Body Part + Direction + Quality**
  - "Perform external rotation of the humerus to 90 degrees of abduction"

- **Preparation + Action + Result**
  - "Maintaining neutral lumbar spine, engage rectus abdominis during thoracic flexion"

- **Sensory Cue + Action**
  - "Noting proprioceptive feedback from the ischial tuberosities, initiate anterior pelvic tilt"

#### Instruction Sequence

1. **Orientation**: Where attention should focus
2. **Action**: What movement to perform
3. **Refinement**: How to improve the position
4. **Breath**: Coordination with breathing
5. **Awareness**: What to notice or feel

#### Safety-Forward Communication

- Precede challenging movements with precautions
- Offer modification before presenting full pose
- Use permissive language ("You may feel..." rather than "You will feel...")
- Include frequent reminders to respect physical limitations

### Encouragement and Motivation

#### Appropriate Encouragement

- Acknowledge effort rather than achievement
- Recognize progress over perfection
- Emphasize sensation over appearance
- Celebrate consistency and commitment

#### Motivational Language

- Focus on functional improvements
- Connect practice to daily life benefits
- Acknowledge the challenge while offering support
- Use inclusive "we" language when appropriate

        </li>
        {path.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            {index === path.length - 1 ? (
              <span aria-current="page">{item.label}</span>
            ) : (
              <a href={item.url}>{item.label}</a>
