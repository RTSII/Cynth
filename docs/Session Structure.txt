## Instructional Language Guidelines

### Vocabulary Standards

#### Technical Terminology Usage

NOTE: Cynthia (User) is a retired medical professional with extensive knowledge of anatomy and medical terminology. Use proper technical terms to engage users' cognitive abilities. This approach supports the future CynthAI Brain Activity feature that will incorporate mini quiz games/puzzles focused on Science/Medicine subjects.

#### Approved Terminology Examples

| Technical Term | Description for Context |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| External rotation | Movement of a limb around its long axis away from the midline |
| Anterior tilt | Forward tipping movement of the pelvis |
| Scapular retraction | Drawing shoulder blades together toward spine |
| Pronate | Rotation of forearm that turns palm downward |
| Dorsiflexion | Movement that brings top of foot closer to shin |

### Instruction Phrasing

#### Effective Instruction Patterns

- **Action + Body Part + Direction + Quality**
  - "Perform external rotation of the humerus to 90 degrees of abduction"

- **Preparation + Action + Result**
  - "Maintaining neutral lumbar spine, engage rectus abdominis during thoracic flexion"

- **Sensory Cue + Action**
  - "Noting proprioceptive feedback from the ischial tuberosities, initiate anterior pelvic tilt"

#### Instruction Sequence

1. **Orientation**: Where attention should focus
2. **Action**: What movement to perform
3. **Refinement**: How to improve the position
4. **Breath**: Coordination with breathing
5. **Awareness**: What to notice or feel

#### Safety-Forward Communication

- Precede challenging movements with precautions
- Offer modification before presenting full pose
- Use permissive language ("You may feel..." rather than "You will feel...")
- Include frequent reminders to respect physical limitations

### Encouragement and Motivation

#### Appropriate Encouragement

- Acknowledge effort rather than achievement
- Recognize progress over perfection
- Emphasize sensation over appearance
- Celebrate consistency and commitment

#### Motivational Language

- Focus on functional improvements
- Connect practice to daily life benefits
- Acknowledge the challenge while offering support
- Use inclusive "we" language when appropriate
