# Tai Chi for Seniors Program Specification

## Overview

The Tai Chi for Seniors program is designed as a complementary practice to Chair Yoga, offering seniors a gentle, flowing approach to movement that emphasizes balance, coordination, and mind-body connection. This program integrates traditional Tai Chi principles with seated and supported standing variations to ensure accessibility for practitioners at all mobility levels.

## Core Principles

1. **Slow, Deliberate Movement**: All movements are performed slowly with intentional control
2. **Breath Coordination**: Synchronized breathing with each movement
3. **Postural Alignment**: Emphasis on proper alignment even in seated positions
4. **Energy Awareness**: Focus on the flow of energy (chi) through the body
5. **Mindfulness**: Present-moment awareness throughout practice
6. **Progressive Learning**: Building from simple to complex movements

## Program Structure

Like the chair yoga program, the Tai Chi program follows a year-long progression through three levels:

### Novice Level (Months 1-4)
- Focus: Basic movements, breath coordination, postural awareness
- Practice Duration: 15-20 minutes
- Repetitions: 8-12 per exercise
- Rest: As needed

### Active Level (Months 5-8)
- Focus: Movement sequences, weight shifting, energy flow
- Practice Duration: 20-30 minutes
- Repetitions: 12-16 per exercise
- Rest: Minimal between exercises

### Advanced Level (Months 9-12)
- Focus: Complete form sequences, deeper energy work, enhanced balance
- Practice Duration: 30-45 minutes
- Repetitions: 16-24 per exercise or continuous flow
- Rest: Primarily between form sequences
