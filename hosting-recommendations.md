## Creating a Complete Solution

For Cynthia's needs, I recommend this combination:

1. **Vimeo Pro** ($20/month) for hosting all exercise videos
2. **Expo Application Services** ($29/month) for app deployment and updates
3. **OpenAI API** (approximately $10/month) for generating personalized inspirational content

- Ability to create fresh, personalized inspirational content

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Video Preparation**: Record videos in 1080p and use Vimeo's encoding options to optimize for iOS devices.

2. **Offline Access**: Configure the app to download key videos for offline viewing, enabling Cynthia to practice without an internet connection.

3. **Music Licensing**: For the music player functionality, consider using royalty-free music from services like Epidemic Sound or Artlist to avoid copyright issues.

4. **Automatic Updates**: Configure Expo EAS to push updates automatically, so Cynthia always has the latest version without manual intervention.

5. **Backup Strategy**: Create regular backups of Cynthia's progress data to ensure she never loses her achievement history.

Feel free to reach out if you need any clarification or assistance with setting up these services. This combination will create a seamless experience for Cynthia on both her iPhone and iPad.
